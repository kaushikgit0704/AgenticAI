Hold. The stock is currently trading below its 50-day moving average ($69.55 vs. $77.05), signaling a bearish trend and potential short-term downside pressure. While the RSI reading of 28.6 indicates an oversold condition that could support a technical rebound, the recent negative average return of -0.15% and the low volatility (1.82%) suggest insufficient momentum to trigger an immediate reversal. Without confirmation of a breakout above the 50-day SMA or rising volume to validate the oversold bounce, holding is the most prudent strategy to avoid further downside while preserving capital. Monitor for near-term price action above $75 to reassess bullish potential.
