Based on CTSH's current performance metrics, I recommend a **Buy** position. The stock is trading at $69.26, significantly below its 50-day SMA of $76.59, indicating short-term bearish momentum. However, the extremely low RSI of 17.99 signals deep oversold conditions (typically below 30 is oversold, with values below 20 being strongly oversold), suggesting a high probability of a technical reversal. While the negative average return of -17.14% reflects recent underperformance, this aligns with the oversold indicator, which historically precedes price rebounds in volatile markets. The low volatility (1.8185) implies minimal downward risk and stability, making this an ideal short-term buying opportunity. I advise implementing a stop-loss near $67 to protect capital if the reversal stalls. For optimal results, monitor if CTSH closes above the $70 level within the next 2-3 weeks as confirmation of the bullish reversal.
